/* 
 * All queries until now were done over the distributed hash table (DHT)
 * except for the promoted posts which are saved in the blockchain. In 
 * the following we will use the torrents of the users to query the merged
 * timeline of the followings of that user (what a client would display 
 * under "home") every 15s. For that we first have to load the accounts that 
 * are present on the server into freech-lib-js. After that the torrents of 
 * the followings of a particular account are activated. This defines the 
 * active user for these torrents. All torrents that have the same active
 * user are then updated and queried simultanously using the "getlasthave"
 * and "getposts" JSON-RPC methods. Initiating the queryies is then done 
 * with the same functions as used in the previous examples. Here, the 
 * doLatestPostUntil function is used to display the posts from the last 
 * 24h of all followings of the user martkistdevs.
 * 
 * Note that as freech-lib-js starts with an empty cache it will first 
 * query the latest posts of all torrents whether or not they posted in 
 * the last 24h. This is done so that if the query is done repeatedly 
 * (like here) it can look for updates using a single "getlasthave" request 
 * and issue more requests only if needed.
