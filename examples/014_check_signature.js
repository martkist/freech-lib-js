/*
 * The following example demonstrates how freech-lib-js internally verifies signatures. 
 * If signature verification is activated (set to either "background" or "instant") 
 * freech-lib-js will try to verify the signatures of all resources queried through 
 * the JSON-RPC. In "background" mode the callback of the query will be run before 
 * the signature is verified to maintain responsiveness. In "instant" mode the callback 
 * of the query is only run after a sucessfull signature verification. In both cases an 
 * unsucesfull signature verification will call errorfunc. Try messing with the signature 
 * and changing the signature verification mode.
